# Bowman 3D
A basic, 3D archery simulation and environment using basic OpenGL functions. 
## Installation
  Simply clone the repository and run Bowman 3D.exe. Will only work on x86 Windows machines.
  
## Compilation
  -If using Codeblocks, open Bowman3D.cbp in src. Make sure to tell Codeblocks to link/include to OpenGL/freeglut and then it should compile as     is.
  
  -Otherwise, compile main.c with your compiler of choice and make sure to tell the compiler to link and include with OpenGL/Freeglut.
  
  -For both options, make sure to have freeglut.dll in the same directory as the new .exe when running it.
